Too many!\nWhile you’d be right to keep such tiny items out of the recycling when they’re loose (they’d just fall through the sorting equipment at the facility), metal bottle tops can actually be recycled with a little bit of forethought.\nFor steel bottle caps, such as those from beer bottles, save them up in an empty steel tin until it’s half-full, then crimp the tin closed so the caps can’t fall out, and off to recycling they go.\nAluminium caps can receive the same treatment in an aluminium can.",
