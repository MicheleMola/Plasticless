# <a name="statement"></a>App Statement
An App that raises awareness about plastic pollution and that gives the user alternative ways of using plastic products in order to reduce one's plastic footprint by addressing simple missions, objectives and a waste monitoring system.           

# <a name="intro"></a>Introduction
The challenge that we wanted to address is <b>"reduce plastic pollution"</b> and we concluded that we could reduce the use and especially plastic waste through a solution (app) that implemented a gamification model. The user is led to face missions that have as their common objective to reduce and minimize plastic waste, moreover there is a section for monitoring waste over time, so that the user can compare data in a period of time.

# <a name="journey"></a>Journey
<b>RocketUP</b> first engaged in identifying a compelling challenge, then we started an investigation on plastic pollution that led us to the solution.
